# CMPI6

This repo contains jupyter notebooks to download and analyse climate data from https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/esg-search.

The notebooks follow this guide https://claut.gitlab.io/man_ccia/index.html, however they are focused on the CMIP6 project.

Download_data_2070-2100_1980-2014_historical_ssp585 --> notebook to download CMIP6 surface temperature data, experiments historical and SSP5-8.5, models ACCESS-CM2, CMCC-ESM2 and MPI-ESM1-2-LR, time span 1980-2014 and 2070-2100

Download_data_2015-2100_ssp585 --> notebook to download CMIP6 surface temperature data, experiment SSP5-8.5, models ACCESS-CM2, CMCC-ESM2 and MPI-ESM1-2-LR, time span 2015-2100

Temperature_change_2070-2100_vs_1980-2014 --> notebook to compute the average temperature change for the period 2070-2100 with repsect to 1980-2014

Yearly_temperature_Europe_ssp585 --> notebook to compute the evolution of the yearly temperature in Europe for the period 2015-2100

The repo contains figures illustrating the results.
